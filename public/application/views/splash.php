					<h3>Keep track of billable hours</h3>
					<h4>Never again work for free or guess when it's invoice time!</h4>
					<p>We've all done it... Go to a coffee shop, put in a few hours of work for a client's website, jot down when we started working on a napkin. Work is our first priority, who wants to keep track of all these hours? Forget the dirty napkin and estimating of hours, and use our simple yet professional time tracking interface.</p>

					<h3>Professional To-Do Lists</h3>
					<h4>More efficient than hunting through emails!</h4>
					<p>No longer will you have to sift through email chains or check off items on scattered to-do lists. NeoInvoice integrates an issue tracking system where selected users can create tickets and assign them to other users or groups of users.</p>

					<h3>Impressive Invoices and PDFs</h3>
					<h4>Automatic professional invoices and printable documents!</h4>
					<p>Tired of downloading Word templates for invoices and manually typing in each entry? NeoInvoice will take the information you enter for particular projects and generate Invoices for you! Specify the level of detail you'd like the client to see, and click send. Invoice reminders will (optionally) be emailed out a week before they are due.</p>

					<h3>Track payments and due dates</h3>
					<h4>Simpler than sticky notes, we do the math for you!</h4>
					<p>Did a client mail you a check? Send some money over Paypal? Swipe a card with your POS system? Login to NeoInvoice and put in the amount of the payment and the day it was received (and the method of payment, if you're so inclined). If the sum of the received equals (or exceeds) the invoice amount, it gets marked as fully paid!</p>
